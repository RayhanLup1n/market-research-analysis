## ðŸ“Š Market Research Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains a Streamlit application for performing market research analysis on a sample superstore dataset. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations and insights into sales and profit performance across different segments and regions.

### Repository Contents

- **`app.py`**: The main Streamlit application file that serves as the entry point for the dashboard. This script includes all the logic for loading the data, preprocessing it, and generating the visualizations and metrics displayed in the dashboard.
  
- **`superstore.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the superstore dataset. This notebook walks through various data preprocessing steps, visualizations, and insights that were used to inform the design of the Streamlit app.
  
- **`superstore.py`**: A Python script version of the Jupyter Notebook (`superstore.ipynb`). This script contains similar content but is structured for use in a standalone Python environment.

- **`Market Research.xlsx`**: Excel file containing the market research dataset used for analysis in the dashboard.

- **`Sample - Superstore.csv`**: CSV file containing a sample of the superstore dataset, used as an additional data source.

- **`Gradient_Boosting_Model.pkl`** and **`Random_Forest_Model.pkl`**: Pre-trained machine learning models saved in pickle format. These models are used in the dashboard to predict the profitability of orders based on input features.

### Features

- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter data by year range and segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) to focus on specific subsets of the dataset.
  
- **Sales and Profit Analysis**: Visualizations include line charts showing sales and profit performance over time, as well as bar charts highlighting the top 10 cities by sales and profit.

- **Model Evaluation**: The app includes an ROC Curve analysis for evaluating the performance of machine learning models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) trained on the dataset to predict profitability.

### Installation

To run the Streamlit application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/streamlit-market-research.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd streamlit-market-research
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Deployment

This application is also deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud. You can access the live version of the app [here](https://your-app-name.streamlit.app).

### Data

The dataset used in this project is a sample superstore dataset that contains detailed information on orders, products, customers, and sales across different segments and regions. This data is utilized to perform analysis on sales performance, profitability, and customer segmentation.

### Usage

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The Jupyter Notebook (`superstore.ipynb`) can be used to explore the dataset, understand the relationships between different features, and identify trends.
  
- **Dashboard Interaction:** The Streamlit app (`app.py`) allows users to interact with the data through various filters and visualizations, providing insights into key business metrics such as sales, profit, and performance across different segments.
